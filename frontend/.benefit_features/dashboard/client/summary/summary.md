Goal
Generate a reusable, responsive container component that handles the main content and a right-hand filter panel. This component must be designed to fit adjacently to an existing, fixed-width Left Navigation Sidebar. The solution must prevent Next.js hydration mismatches.

Implementation Details
Context: The component must assume it is placed inside a container that handles the overall h-screen and a fixed-width external Left Navigation. The component itself will manage its full available height (h-full) and remaining width (flex-1).

Assumed Parent Structure: <div className="flex h-screen"><nav className="w-[200px]">...</nav><div className="flex-1"> **<AdaptiveFilterLayout />** </div></div>

Breakpoints and Logic: The mobile/desktop switch must happen at the Tailwind CSS lg breakpoint (1024px).

use-media-query.ts Hook: Create a client component hook to safely check the lg breakpoint. It must return false during the server render phase to prevent hydration errors.

AdaptiveFilterLayout.tsx Component: (The new reusable component)

It must be a Client Component ('use client').

It accepts three generic props: Header, MainContent, and FilterPanel (ReactNode).

Structure: Use a vertical flex column (flex flex-col h-full) to contain a fixed Header and the dynamic content area (flex-1).

Desktop View (â‰¥1024px): Use ResizablePanelGroup (horizontal direction) to split the space below the header.

Left Panel (Main): MainContent (default size 75, min 50).

Right Panel (Filter): FilterPanel (default size 25, min 15, max 35).

Use a persistent autoSaveId ("adaptive-admin-filter-v1").

Mobile View (<1024px):

Display the MainContent directly below the header.

Use a Sheet component, triggered by a button in the header, to render the FilterPanel. The sheet must be placed on the right side (side="right"). The trigger button should be placed within the Header.

Styling & Scrolling: The content areas within the main content and filter panel must use ScrollArea to manage local vertical scrolling, ensuring the rest of the layout remains fixed.
